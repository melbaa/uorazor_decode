# History
Publishing this is mostly an excuse to write about UO. So join me in this 
nostalgia trip.  

Once upon a time, we played Ultima Online. It's a MMO that gives an unmatched
to this day choice of playstyles and freedom. The maps are huge, loadscreens
nonexistent and you could do whatever you felt like, for example:
fishing, treasure hunting, crafting, building and decorating houses and your
character, participate in tournaments, trade, socialize, be a thief, 
a headhunter, participate in alliance wars with hundreds of players, pvm,
pvp (consensual and nonconsensual), explore dungeons, do quests, manage shops,
ruin the economy by flooding the server with cheap merchandise, gamble, place
traps, poison food, have pets, play annoying music forcing hundreds of people
to turn off their sound etc etc.--

Maintaining your ingame property is quite complex, so there are all kinds of
helper programs for navigation, storage, maintaing armor sets etc. One of them
is Razor. The program has the feature to save your password for each of your
accounts, so you don't have to type it every time. I'm sure people with 20
crafting accounts really appreciated this. But at some time you inevitably
forget your password. This is where this project comes in.
